## 🧠 Overview

This application serves as a bridge between biotechnology, machine learning, and web development. It empowers users to gain potential health insights from their genetic data by:

1.  Allowing users to upload their DNA-derived data (in CSV format).
2.  Analyzing the uploaded data using a pre-trained Machine Learning model (`RandomForestClassifier`).
3.  Presenting a simple prediction (e.g., "Healthy" or "At-Risk") based on the genetic features analyzed.

**Disclaimer:** This application is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It should **not** be used for actual medical diagnosis or health decisions. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.

## ✨ Features

-   ✅ **DNA Data Upload:** Supports uploading user DNA reports in `.csv` format.
-   ✅ **ML-Powered Analysis:** Integrates a trained `scikit-learn` model for prediction.
-   ✅ **Secure File Handling:** Uses `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` to prevent directory traversal attacks.
-   ✅ **Simple Prediction Output:** Provides a clear health status prediction (e.g., Healthy/At-Risk).
-   ✅ **Lightweight & Deployable:** Built with Flask, making it easy to run locally or deploy to platforms like Heroku or Render.
-   ✅ **Beginner-Friendly Code:** Includes comments explaining key parts of the application logic.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a simple client-server architecture:

```plaintext
+---------------------+      +-----------------------+      +--------------------+      +---------------------+
|   Client (Browser)  | ---> | Flask Backend (Server)| ---> | Load ML Model (.pkl)| ---> | Make Prediction     |
| (Uploads DNA CSV)   |      | (Receives & Processes)|      | (using joblib)      |      | (using pandas data) |
+---------------------+      +-----------------------+      +--------------------+      +----------+----------+
                                       ↑                                                        |
                                       |                                                        ↓
                                       +--------------------------------------------------------+
                                       | Render Result Template
                                       | (Sends prediction back to Client)
                                       ↓
                            +---------------------+
                            |   Client (Browser)  |
                            | (Displays Result)   |
                            +---------------------+
```

### ** 🚀Getting Started**
This section tells users how to set up the project on their machine. It includes installation instructions and steps to get the app running. For this, you'd typically:

- Install dependencies.
- Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
- Run the application locally.

#### Getting Started Example:

```markdown
## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
```
### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dna-health-dashboard.git
cd dna-health-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### **Usage**
In this section, you explain how users will interact with your app after running it locally.

- You’ll list steps on how to interact with the app.
- Include specific details, like how to upload a CSV file and view predictions.

#### Usage Example:

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
```
```

### **Project Structure**
The **Project Structure** section helps users understand how the app is organized.

It lists the main files and directories in the project with brief descriptions for each.

#### Project Structure Example:

```markdown
## 📁 Project Structure
```
```plaintext
DNA_Health_Dashboard/
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application
├── models.py
├── routes.py
├── app_init.py
├── ml_model.py             # Machine learning model training script
├── dna_model.pkl           # Serialized ML model using joblib
├── your_database.db              # SQLite3 database file

You can upload the screenshots in a folder (e.g., `/screenshots`) and reference them in this section.

#### Screenshots Example:

```markdown
## 🖼️ Screenshots

| Upload Page                | Result Page                |
